The project "Hand Gesture Controlled Cursor " aims to develop a virtual mouse system that utilizes computer vision techniques to track hand gestures and hand tip detection using a built-in camera or webcam. The system allows users to control the computer cursor, perform left and right clicks, scrolling functions, and other mouse operations without the need for a physical mouse device. The abstract of the project provides an overview of the proposed system. It mentions that the system employs deep learning algorithms for detecting hands and recognizing hand gestures. By capturing hand gestures through a webcam or built-in camera, the system can virtually control the computer without the use of a physical mouse.
